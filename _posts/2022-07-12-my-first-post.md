# Welcome to my first post!

I just set up this site using Jekyll and github pages. I followed [this guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmSrQCDsMv4) on YouTube. I believe the only change I had to make was add `gem "webrick"` at the bottom of the Gemfile. Before Jekyll I just had the contents of my [about page](https://schnaible.github.io/about/) as a single page site. Please read that page to learn more about me. Just as a first post let me tell you about myself:

I am currently looking for a software development or data science job. I graduated from Sonoma State University several months ago with a major in Computer Science and a minor in Philosophy. I am familiar with C++ and Python as well as some experience with JavaScript and MySQL.

As I mentioned, I am interested in Data Science and working with Python. I've taken courses in Data Science and Natural Language Processing and hope to dive into more advanced topics like Machine Learning. I would also like to get into game development more seriously and possibly make web games with JavaScript. I have previously made [Minesweeper](https://festive-shaw-984346.netlify.app/) in React.
