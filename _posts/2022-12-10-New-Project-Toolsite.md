### Introduction

Since getting a job, I haven't been working much on personal projects. I've decided to try to get back into some web-dev work. I decided to start with a basic website with HTML/CSS and focus on reviewing JavaScript, before I decide to move to a framework like React. There have been a few simple tools implemented so far:
- Coin Flip (Includes Number of Flips)
- Dice Roll (Sides: 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 20, 100)
- Card Draw (Standard 52 playing card deck)
- Echo Text (Displays what the user types back onto the page)
- Decision Maker (Enter up to four options and let the computer decide)

### Access the Site!

Here is the (temporary) link to Toolsite, or whatever it will be called: [Toolsite](https://elegant-haupia-094e91.netlify.app)

I am looking into registering a domain, which willy likely change the name of the website. For now I am using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) for hosting any simple projects I have, including the [Minesweeper](https://festive-shaw-984346.netlify.app) game I made in React. I would love to look into doing self-hosting and maintaining a small web-server from my home.



### Future Plans

Obviously this is a very bare-bones site at the moment. As mentioned, I plan on implementing some sort of framework, such as React. This will help me with stylization and implementing animations. Once that happens, I will likely keep the basic version for those who access the site on low-end or older machines. 

#### Animations

Once I implement a framework, again, likely to be React, I want to add some simple animations for the simple tools. This will give some visual queue to the user that something is actually happening. These would be most useful for the coin flip, dice roll, and card draw.

#### Echo Text

I will likely implement a few features to make this more interesting of a feature. One idea that I will look into is different text-formatting options on the user side. This will let you select a font style, change text color and size, and other formatting tools like underline, bold, and italic text. 

One idea for far down the line is to output the text as a PDF, so people can create and print simple PDFs from their browser. 

#### Decision Maker

This will likely be my next update. I will implement the ability to add even more options for the computer to pick from (and delete them if the user wants to reduce the number again). One animation idea I had for this would be having the options listed on a roulette wheel.
