        <p>Hello, (centered) World!</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
                    
        <p>I am a recent graduate from Sonoma State with a B.S. in Computer Science. I majored in 
            Computer Science and have a minor in Philosophy. 
            I am interested in a vareity of things from Data Science to Game Development.
            Currently on the job hunt and open to any kind of work avaiable. Most of my 
            programming experience is in C++ and Python. I have also done a couple websites, such as this one 
            that you're on, with React JS. 
        </p>

        <h2>Personal</h2>
        
        <p>  Outside of my professional life I enjoy playing many video games. I'm currently playing a lot of Final Fantasy XIV and FFVII.
            I really enjoy doing ceramics and have made pieces from Spirited Away and Legend of Zelda. I have not been able to touch clay in 
            quite a while so I hope that's something I can get in to again soon.
        </p>
