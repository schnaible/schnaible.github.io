        <h2>About Me</h2>
                    
        <p>I am a recent graduate from Sonoma State with a B.S. in Computer Science. I majored in 
            Computer Science and have a minor in Philosophy. 
            I am interested in a vareity of things from Data Science to Game Development.
            Currently on the job hunt and open to any kind of work avaiable. Most of my 
            programming experience is in C++ and Python. I have also done a couple websites, such as this one 
            that you're on, with React JS. 
        </p>

        <h2>Personal</h2>
        
        <p>  Outside of my professional life I enjoy playing many video games. I'm currently playing a lot of Final Fantasy XIV and FFVII.
            I really enjoy doing ceramics and have made pieces from Spirited Away and Legend of Zelda. I have not been able to touch clay in 
            quite a while so I hope that's something I can get in to again soon.
        </p>

        <h2>Here are some projects that I have worked on.</h2>

        <p>
            <h3>Minesweeper in React</h3>
            <p>Here is a simple Minesweeper clone done in React.
                It has three different difficulties. The bombs are generated
                randomly each playthrough.
                <br/>Left click to check a space, right click to flag a bomb.
                <br/>
                <ul>
                Known Bugs: 
                    <li>- Timer starts before selecting difficulty and does not stop.</li>
                    <li>- Flagging a bomb, then clicking 'show bombs' on & off will cause flagged bombs to be displayed.</li>
                </ul>

            <h3><i>Who Said It?</i> - NLP Project for Text Classification</h3>
            <p>
                This was a group project done for a Natural Langauge Processing course. Work was done from research to data gathering/processing as well as training and testing the model.
                <br/> We gathered poems by Shakespeare and Edgar Allen Poe to train our model with.
                <br/> Utilized Huggingface transformeres with a DistilBERT model for sequence classification.
