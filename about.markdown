## About Me

I am a recent graduate from Sonoma State with a B.S. in Computer Science and a minor in Philosophy. I am interested in a variety of things from Data Science to Game Development. Currently on the job hunt and open to any kind of work available. Most of my programming experience is in C++ and Python. I have also developed a couple websites, such as this one that you're on.

## Personal

Outside of my professional life I enjoy playing many video games. I'm currently playing a lot of Final Fantasy XIV and FFVII. I really enjoy working with ceramics and have made pieces from Spirited Away and Legend of Zelda. I have not been able to touch clay in quite a while, so I hope that's something I can get into again soon.

## Here are some projects that I have worked on.

# Minesweeper in React

- Simple Minesweeper clone done in React.
- Three difficulties with bombs being randomly generated each playthrough.
- Left Click: check a space &nbsp; Right Click: flag a bomb
- Known Bugs:
  - Timer starts before selecting the difficulty and does not stop when game is over.
  - Flagging a bomb while "Show Bombs" is toggled will cause flagged bombs to behave improperly.

- Fractions can be created with integers, floats, and strings.
- Access to arithmetic (+, -, \*, ++, +=) and logical (!=, ==, <, >) operations.

# _Who Said It?_ - NLP Project for Text Classification

- Group project done for a Natural Language Processing course.
- Work was done from research to data gathering/processing as well as training and testing the model.
- Utilized Huggingface transformers with a DistilBERT model for sequence classification.
