## About Me

My name is Kyler,  I'm currently working on a site with various tools, such as a decision maker, coin flip, and dice roll. I am also reviewing some Data Science and Machine Learning principles for a potential project. I am currently employed as a Quality Assurance Engineer and have a B.S. in Computer Science and a minor in Philosophy. I hope to return back to university and get a Masters (or higher) in a related field.

## Personal

I am planning on doing a full playthrough of Chrono Trigger (DS) because I never finished my first time playing the game. I've recently made it to Post-Shadowbringers in FFXIV! I haven't made a lot of time recently for other hobbies, but I may look into starting a couple of shows. 

## Here are some projects that I have worked on.

# Minesweeper in React

- Simple Minesweeper clone done in React.
- Three difficulties with bombs being randomly generated each playthrough.
- Left Click: check a space &nbsp; Right Click: flag a bomb
- Known Bugs:
  - Timer starts before selecting the difficulty and does not stop when game is over.
  - Flagging a bomb while "Show Bombs" is toggled will cause flagged bombs to behave improperly.

# Operator Overloading for Fractions in C++

- Designed a class that allows the use of common operators with fractions.
- Fractions can be created with integers, floats, and strings.
- Access to arithmetic (+, -, \*, ++, +=) and logical (!=, ==, <, >) operations.

# _Who Said It?_ - NLP Project for Text Classification

- Group project done for a Natural Language Processing course.
- Work was done from research to data gathering/processing as well as training and testing the model.
- Utilized Huggingface transformers with a DistilBERT model for sequence classification.
- Trained model with poems from Shakespeare and Edgar Allen Poe.
